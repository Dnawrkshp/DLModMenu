Ratchet Deadlocked HD NetCheat PS3 Plugin
A GUI that implements C# to create an interactable Mod Menu in game.


A video explaining the mod menu I made: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2vRyLeHMn4
Actual mod menu is available in the root directory of this (test menu.mettle).

Both the CodeCompiler.dll and the DLModMenu.dll need to be put in the Plugins folder of NetCheat PS3.
